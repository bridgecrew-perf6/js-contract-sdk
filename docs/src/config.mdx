# Configuration

Contracts often deploys in different environments and networks. For example, usually you can scaffold local environment based on node sandbox and deploy contracts to this network for test use-cases.

### Provide configuration

Add `contract.config.js` to the root of project for initialize configuration of your contract.
If you scaffold project by the `create-we-contract` configuration set by default.

### Default configuration

```js
module.exports = {
  image: "my-contract",
  name: 'My Contract Name',
  version: '1.0.1',
  networks: {
    /// ...
  }
}
```

The common use of config file is provide image name and name of contract that will displays in explorer, also you can provide image tag
(`name` prop) that will used to push contract to registry.

### Networks configuration

In `networks` section you should provide specific configuration for your network.
For example, if you want to deploy contract to sandbox network you should provide `seed phrase` of contract initiator,
`registry` if you used specific docker registry, and should provide specific `nodeAddress` to deploy.
For specify initialize params, set function in params.init

```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    "sandbox": {
        seed: "#your secret seed phrase" // or get it from env process.env.MY_SECRET_SEED

        // also you can provide
        registry: 'localhost:5000',
        nodeAddress: 'http://localhost:6862',
        params: {
            init: () => ({
                paramName: 'paramValue'
            })
        }
    }
  }
}
```

CAUTION: DO NOT publish your secret phrases in public repositories.

### Deploy contract

To deploy contract to sandbox network run command below:

```
we-toolkit deploy -n sandbox
```
