## Core concepts

The basics of making contract class is specifying class an annotations per methods.
The most important annotations is:

* `Contract` - register class as contract
* `Action` - register action handler of contract
* `State` - decorates a class property for access to contract state
* `Param` - param decorator that map transaction params to contract class action params

```ts
@Contract
export class ExampleContract {
    @State state: ContractState;

    @Action
    greeting(@Param('name') name: string) {
        this.state.set('Greeting', `Hello, ${name}`);
    }
}
```

## Manage State

ContractState class expose useful methods to write to contract state. Currently available data types in contract state you can find in node documentation.
Contract SDK supports all currently available data types in contract state.


### Write

Easiest way is to use `set` method to write state. Internal this method automatically cast type of data.

```ts
    this.state.set('key', 'value')
```

For explicit type casting you should use methods in example below:


```ts
// for binary
this.state.setBinary('binary', Buffer.from('example', 'base64'));

// for boolean
this.state.setBool('boolean', true);

// for integer
this.state.setInt('integer', 102);

// for string
this.state.setString('string', 'example');
```



### Read

Read state is currently async, and behavior of reading is different by contract configuration.
By default Contract Strict mode is false, and trying to get unavailable keys is not throws error.


```ts
@Contract
export class ExampleContract {
    @State state: ContractState;

    @Action
    async exampleAction(@Param('name') name: string) {
        const stateValue: string  = await this.state.get('value', 'default-value');
    }
}
```

Caution: Method state.get can't know about internal state type in runtime, for explicit type casting use casted method
`getBinary`, `getString`, `getBool`, `getNum`



## Write Actions

The key decorators is `Action` and `Param`

### Init action

For describe on create contract action provide to the action decorator param `onInit=true`

```ts
@Contract
export class ExampleContract {
    @State state: ContractState;

    @Action({onInit: true})
    exampleAction(@Param('name') name: string) {

        this.state.set('state-initial-value', 'initialized')
    }
}
```

By default name of contract method is action used, for describe specific name of action provide param `name` to decorator

```ts
@Contract
export class ExampleContract {
    @State state: ContractState;

    @Action({name: 'specificActionName'})
    exampleAction() {
        // Your code
    }
}
```
